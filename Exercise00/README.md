# RingBuffer Exercise

This exercise involves testing a `RingBuffer` implementation in Java using JUnit.

## Instructions

1. **Edit `RingBufferTest.java`**: Open and modify the `RingBufferTest.java` file to write your test cases.

2. **Implement Test Cases**: Write at least five test cases covering various aspects of the `RingBuffer` implementation. Include both positive cases (basic usage scenarios) and negative cases (scenarios where exceptions are expected).

3. **Positive Cases**: Test scenarios where the `RingBuffer` behaves correctly, such as adding elements, removing elements, and checking size.

4. **Negative Cases**: Test scenarios where the `RingBuffer` should throw exceptions or handle errors, such as trying to remove an element from an empty buffer.

5. **JUnit Framework**: Use the JUnit framework correctly. Annotate your test methods with `@Test`, use assertions to verify behavior, and set up any necessary preconditions.

6. **Write Good Unit Tests**: Follow recommendations for writing good unit tests, such as testing one thing at a time, keeping tests independent, and using meaningful test names.

7. **Ensure Tests Pass**: Run your tests to ensure they pass. Any failing test might indicate a bug in the `RingBuffer` implementation.
